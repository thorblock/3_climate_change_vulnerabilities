# 3_climate_change_vulnerabilities
Project 3: This project aims to analyze and map socioeconomic variables in conjunction with urban tree canopy coverage in Portland, OR. Trees provide numerous benefits to communities, including improved air quality, reduced heat islands, enhanced aesthetics, and support for biodiversity. However, the distribution of tree coverage within a city or region is often uneven, leading to disparities in these benefits among different neighborhoods and populations.
Wealthier neighborhoods in many urban areas tend to have more extensive tree coverage than lower-income communities. This inequity can result from historical factors, including redlining and discriminatory policies that limit access to resources in certain areas. As a result, neighborhoods with fewer trees may face higher temperatures, more significant pollution, and a diminished quality of life.

socioeconomic climate change vulnerabilities: Our team looked at the Area Median Income for all zip codes in the Portland area, selecting the zipcodes to research with the highest, lowest and area median income (AMI) reported. We used a housing market tool provided by Home Forward, the area housing authority, that is used to determine rent reasonableness. This tool is put together for local nonprofits to use and is based on a market study of the rental rates in the area.  We reviewed Base Rent for those areas, which does not include any amenities for the units. This is typically identified as a multiplex unit, with one bathroom.  Amenities include features such as a pool, playground, gym, covered parking, onsite management, washer/dryer or air conditioning in the unit.  Each amenity adds value to the unit price so we chose to use base rent for these areas to reduce confusion.  In the Portland housing market, it is very seldom one would actually have a unit with zero amenities, especially as unit size increases.    When reviewing the data for the housing prices, it was interesting to see the base rents were the exact same for the zip codes that were the highest and median AMI. Even though these zip codes were directly next to each other, there is a difference of $57,619 between the area median income of 97229 and 97210.  The rental market does not take into consideration the income of the people living in the area.  The zip code with the lowest area median income's base rent was much lower.
