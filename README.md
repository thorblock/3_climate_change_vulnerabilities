# 3_climate_change_vulnerabilities
Project 3: This project aims to analyze and map socioeconomic variables in conjunction with urban tree canopy coverage in Portland, OR. Trees provide numerous benefits to communities, including improved air quality, reduced heat islands, enhanced aesthetics, and support for biodiversity. However, the distribution of tree coverage within a city or region is often uneven, leading to disparities in these benefits among different neighborhoods and populations.
Wealthier neighborhoods in many urban areas tend to have more extensive tree coverage than lower-income communities. This inequity can result from historical factors, including redlining and discriminatory policies that limit access to resources in certain areas. As a result, neighborhoods with fewer trees may face higher temperatures, more significant pollution, and a diminished quality of life.

socioeconomic climate change vulnerabilities: Our team looked at the Area Median Income for all zip codes in the Portland area, selecting the zipcodes to research with the highest, lowest and median income reported.
